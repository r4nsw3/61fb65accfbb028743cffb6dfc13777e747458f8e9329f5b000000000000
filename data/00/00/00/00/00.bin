  |   Ashen is an open world co-op action RPG about a wanderer in search    |
  |   of a place to call home.                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Passive Co-Op Multiplayer.                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   As you adventure through Ashen, you'll occasionally encounter other   |
  |   players in a massive open world, akin to the passive multiplayer of   |
  |   Journey. It's up to you to decide how to deal with them - fight       |
  |   together against evil, invite them into your party or simply ignore   |
  |   them.                                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Souls with a Twist.                                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Ashen is faithful to the "souls" genre of stamina-based combat,       |
  |   introducing players to a punishing yet satisfyingly vast world. But   |
  |   here's the twist - no two gameplay experiences are alike. Whether     |
  |   you're exploring bogs, investigating a fjord or pillaging an old      |
  |   palace, where you are at any given moment will dramatically alter     |
  |   the course of your adventure. It's a brutal open world; you're just   |
  |   living in it.                                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Creatures + Combat.                                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Ashen has no shortage of dangerous encounters, from hostile enemies   |
  |   to indigenous creatures. You'll be rewarded for studying the          |
  |   environment and its inhabitants, planning your adventure rather       |
  |   than flying by the seat of your pants. The flora and fauna within     |
  |   the world aren't just fantastical; they're often fatal. Each          |
  |   confrontation, no matter how trivial, has potentially dire            |
  |   consequences.                                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Crafting is Key.                                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   As you discover survivors, you'll have the choice to invite them to   |
  |   your Town. But these aren't mere adventurers - they're potential      |
  |   collaborators, bringing a plethora of crafting skills, from           |
  |   blacksmithing to foraging expertise, in tow.                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Story + Score.                                                        |

  |   Famed fantasy author Mark Lawrence (The Broken Empire trilogy) and    |
  |   renowned band Foreign Fields collaborated closely with the            |
  |   development team at Aurora44 to craft a cohesive and unique           |

  |   The wanderer accompanies a mother on a quest to find her lost         |
  |   daughter. Venturing far from familiar ash-covered shores, players     |
  |   descend into the perilous depths of Nightstorm Isle. Countless        |
  |   horrors lurk below, yet nothing will prepare you for the ancient      |
  |   evil they imprison.                                                   |
  |                                                                         |
